    abstract = {Devoted to multi-task learning and structured output learning,
    operator-valued kernels provide a flexible tool to build vector-valued
    functions in the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. To scale up
    these methods, we extend the celebrated Random Fourier Feature methodology
    to get an approximation of operator-valued kernels. We propose a general
    principle for Operator-valued Random Fourier Feature construction relying
    on a generalization of Bochner’s theorem for translation-invariant
    operator-valued Mercer kernels. We prove the uniform convergence of the
    kernel approximation for bounded and unbounded operator random Fourier
    features using appropriate Bernstein matrix concentration inequality. An
    experimental proof-of-concept shows the quality of the approximation and
    the efficiency of the corresponding linear models on example datasets.},

    abstract = {Random Forests (RFs) are strong machine learning tools for
    classification and regression. However, they remain supervised algorithms,
    and no extension of RFs to the one-class setting has been proposed, except
    for techniques based on second-class sampling. This work fills this gap by
    proposing a natural methodology to extend standard splitting criteria to
    the one-class setting, structurally generalizing RFs to one-class
    classification.  An extensive benchmark of seven state-of-the-art anomaly
    detection algorithms is also presented. This empirically demonstrates the
    relevance of our approach.},
